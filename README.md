# web-app-demo
Trying out some stuff before a hackathon

Install:
- homebrew (for installing various things)
- Anaconda (python packages including scientific stuff)
- PyCharm (code editor)
- Git (for interacting with github)
- mongodb (database)

https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/ide_integration to tell PyCharm where the anaconda version of python is. For using python in terminal use ~/anaconda/bin/python instead of just python (that comes from MacOsX).

Goals:
- Have the ability to enter fish counts
- store fish counts in MongoDB
- average fish
- display a table

Tools:
- flask (webserver)
- html/css for web UI
- pymongo (talking to mongo)
